8.3 Fibonacci Generator

Scenario: You are designing an IoT sensor system where Fibonacci sequence is used for backoff intervals. Write a generator fibonacci(n) that yields first n Fibonacci numbers.

Algorithm:

1. Define function fibonacci(n).

2. Initialize two variables: a=0, b=1.

3. Loop n times:
   • Yield the current value of a.
   • Update values: a, b = b, a + b.

4. Continue until n Fibonacci numbers are generated.

Output:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Result:

Thus, the Python program to implement generators and decorators is successfully executed and completed.
