Aim: To implement Python generators and decorators for efficient data handling and function monitoring, including paginated data retrieval,
Fibonacci sequence generation, and execution time measurement of functions.

8.1 Generation of Paginated Data

You are building a backend system where search results are large. You need to generate results in chunks (pages) of fixed size.Write 
a generator function paginate(data, page_size) that yields one page of results at a time.

Algorithm:

1. Define the function paginate(data, page_size).

2. Iterate through the list from index 0 to len(data) in steps of page_size.

3. In each iteration, yield a sublist containing elements from i to i + page_size.

4. Use the generator to fetch one page at a time.

output:

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
