8.2 Execution Time Decorator

Algorithm:

1. Import the time module.

2. Define a decorator time_it which takes a function.

3. Inside, define a wrapper function that:

   • Records start time.

   • Executes the original function with given arguments.

   • Records end time.

   • Prints execution time.

   • Returns the result.
4.Apply @time_it to any function to measure its runtime.

Output:

compute_square executed in 0.0547 seconds

1800000000000
